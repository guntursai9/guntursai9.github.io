            <strong>LAB-0:</strong><br>
            Lab 0 served as an introduction to the development environment and the course structure. I began by setting up my GitHub repository and ensuring my local system was ready for development with tools like VS Code, Git, and a web server. I also familiarized myself with basic Linux command-line operations and file permissions. This setup phase was essential in establishing the workflow I would use throughout the course, including version control, code deployment, and project organization. By the end of this lab, I had a working foundation for building and managing web applications efficiently.

            <strong>LAB-1:</strong><br>
            This lab introduced me to the core principles of network communication and how web applications interact over HTTP. I used tools like Telnet and Wireshark to inspect low-level request and response patterns, gaining insight into how clients and servers communicate. Additionally, I developed and tested dynamic content using CGI scripts written in C, PHP, and HTML. This hands-on experience laid the groundwork for understanding how web protocols operate behind the scenes and how server-side code responds to client input.

            <strong>LAB-2:</strong><br>
            In this lab, I focused on building the front-end structure of a webpage. I began by using HTML to lay out elements such as text, images, and input forms. I then introduced interactivity through JavaScript, followed by style enhancements using CSS. AJAX allowed me to retrieve data dynamically without reloading the page, and jQuery simplified event handling and DOM manipulation. By combining these technologies, I developed a functional and styled interactive webpage.

            <strong>HACKATHON:</strong><br>
            During the hackathon, I explored and executed multiple forms of reflected XSS attacks, understanding how malicious scripts can be injected and executed in browsers. This exercise deepened my understanding of client-side vulnerabilities. In response, I worked on improving the security of my web applications by incorporating robust input validation, proper output encoding, and safe rendering techniques to prevent XSS in both the Lab 1 echo.php script and the Lab 2 frontend.

            <strong>INDIVIDUAL PROJECT-1:</strong><br>
            For my individual project, I created a professional portfolio website hosted on GitHub Pages. I used Bootstrap to ensure a responsive and mobile-friendly layout, and I incorporated real-time data from external APIs, including weather updates and random jokes. The site structure was enhanced using modular React components, while JavaScript and jQuery handled the logic and dynamic content updates. This project reflects my ability to merge design with functionality and showcases my skills in modern web development practices.
